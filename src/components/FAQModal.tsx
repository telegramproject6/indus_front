        <p>
          The number of tokens you can mine depends on the following key
          factors:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>
            The number of miners online at the moment. The more miners are
            online, the more competitive the mining process becomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            The specific planet where mining takes place. Each planet has a
            limited token supply available for mining within a 9-day period.
            This ensures that mining remains profitable at any stage of the
            game.
          </li>
          <li>
            The multiplier of your spaceship. Spaceships with higher multipliers
            mine more tokens per block, giving you a significant advantage in
            earning rewards.
          </li>
          <li>
            The chance of becoming the "lucky block miner." Every user has a
            chance to be selected as the "lucky miner" for a block. The lucky
            miner receives a special percentage of the block's reward, as
            detailed in the table below.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="pl-5">
          This system is designed to maintain fairness and ensure mining is
          rewarding for all participants. Refer to the table below for more
          details about token supply, rewards, and lucky miner percentages for
          each planet.
